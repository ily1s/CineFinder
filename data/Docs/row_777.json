    "Title": "Gangster Squad",
    "Overview": "Los Angeles, 1949. Ruthless, Brooklyn-born mob king Mickey Cohen runs the show in this town, reaping the ill-gotten gains from the drugs, the guns, the prostitutes and \u2014 if he has his way \u2014 every wire bet placed west of Chicago. And he does it all with the protection of not only his own paid goons, but also the police and the politicians who are under his control. It\u2019s enough to intimidate even the bravest, street-hardened cop\u2026 except, perhaps, for the small, secret crew of LAPD outsiders led by Sgt. John O\u2019Mara and Jerry Wooters who come together to try to tear Cohen\u2019s world apart.",
